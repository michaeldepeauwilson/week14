	<h4>More People Soaking in Less Water</h4>
   <p>
   		New York is one of the most conservative big cities in the country in at least one category: water use. In a thirty-year period, New Yorker's water consumption steadily declined by more than more than 30 percent, according to data from OpenNYC.

	<p>
		Over the 30 years between 1979 and 2009, total consumption of water in the city dropped while the total number of New Yorkers rose by more than one million.
		The drop of water consumption in the face of strong growth shows a quick and deliberate move toward saving water across the city, and several factors contributed to it.

	<p>
		The first is improvement in home appliance technology such as water efficient toilets and less leaky plumbing. The Department of Environmental Protection has also launched series of conservation awareness over those years that resemble current programs like the toilet replacement initiative or Water for the Future program. The result is a savings of more than 75 gallons of water per person over three decades.

	<h4>Comparing Major Metro Counties Water Use</h4>

   		<iframe style="margin:10px 100px 10px 5px;" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QfHfJGsVmPOl9B5nHQ0c5_wE_OnPehcUH8EOTkO33Ng/pubchart?oid=1586389522&amp;format=interactive"></iframe>

   	

   	<p>
   		Water conservation vastly improved as a whole for New York City, and in the larger picture the city's conservative ways truly set it a part. Of the five most populated cities in the United States, the Big Apple is the most conservative city in average water use. Looking at the 2005 data available for the counties of the five largest cities in 2005, New York withdrew the least per person, according to the U.S Geological Survey. Since data for each city was not available the comparison comes from the counties that contain each city. The data for New York comes from all five boroughs and the counties of each of the other four citiesâ€”San Francisco county, Los Angeles county, Cook County in Chicago, and Harris, Fort Bend and Montgomery in Houston. The total, shown in gallons, reveals all water withdrawn for use, not the consumed water.

   	<p>
   		The numbers represent total water withdrawn for those populations, which includes more than just water consumed by individuals. The comparison of total water withdrawn places New York City in second behind Los Angeles, but the per individual comparison shows that the city is by far the most efficient in this category, too. San Franciscans use the most water by far with more than 2,000 gallons used per person in 2005.

   <h4>Conservative Now and into the Future</h4>
   	
   	<p>
   		New York is continuing to make strides with public awareness and infrastructure that promote water conservative. The rapid decline of overall and per capita water use has become a tradition of the big city. The Water for the Future program is also starting construction for repairs this year on two major aqueducts, Catskill and Queens, which supply the drinking water for the city. The repairs are aimed at reducing waste of the water during transportation. In the meantime, New Yorkers will continue to enjoy one of the most conservative water systems in the country.
